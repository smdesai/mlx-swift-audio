# MLX Swift Audio

**This package is in early development. Expect breaking changes.**

## TTS engines

- **Kokoro**: 50+ voices, 9 languages, speed control, streaming
- **Orpheus**: 8 voices, emotional expressions (`<laugh>`, `<sigh>`, etc.)
- **Marvis**: Streaming, quality levels, custom reference audio
- **OuteTTS**: Custom voices with reference audio
- **Chatterbox**: Custom reference audio, emotion control

## Installation

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/DePasqualeOrg/mlx-swift-audio.git", branch: "main")
```

## Usage

```swift
import MLXAudio

// Kokoro - 50+ voices, speed control
let kokoro = KokoroEngine()
try await kokoro.load()
try await kokoro.say("Hello, world!", voice: .afHeart)
try await kokoro.say("Speaking faster", voice: .afNova, speed: 1.5)

// Orpheus - emotional expressions
let orpheus = OrpheusEngine()
try await orpheus.load()
try await orpheus.say("Ha! <laugh> That's funny.", voice: .tara)

// Marvis - streaming audio
let marvis = MarvisEngine()
try await marvis.load()
try await marvis.sayStreaming("This plays as it generates.", voice: .conversationalA)

// OuteTTS - custom voices with reference audio
let outetts = OuteTTSEngine()
try await outetts.load()
let speaker = try await OuteTTSEngine.loadSpeaker(from: "speaker.json")
try await outetts.say("Using reference audio.", speaker: speaker)

// Chatterbox - custom reference audio with emotion control
let chatterbox = ChatterboxEngine()
try await chatterbox.load()
let referenceAudio = try await chatterbox.prepareReferenceAudio(from: audioFileURL)
try await chatterbox.say("Speaking with your reference audio.", referenceAudio: referenceAudio)
```

For more control over playback:

```swift
let kokoro = KokoroEngine()
try await kokoro.load()
let audio = try await kokoro.generate("Hello!", voice: .afHeart)
await audio.play()
```

## Building

Build the library:

```sh
xcodebuild -scheme mlx-audio -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

Build the example app:

```sh
xcodebuild -project 'examples/TTS App/TTS App.xcodeproj' -scheme 'TTS App' -destination 'platform=macOS' build
```

## Legal and ethical considerations

Voice synthesis technology should be used responsibly. Obtain consent before using voice recordings, respect intellectual property and personality rights, never use synthetic voices for deception or fraud, and comply with applicable laws in your jurisdiction.
